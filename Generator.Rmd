After getting some new dataset, doing a proper exploratory data analysis (EDA) is very important part. This help to better undestand the structure of our data, potential problems and project the steps needed to use the particular data set for modelling. 

Most of the data analysts would agree that data preparation (cleaning, putting to the correct format) and exploration of a data set takes big chunk of the time devoted to the project. 

(Un)Fortunately people are lazy, thus some started developing some ways how to spead up the EDA part. 

Here I present 4 R libraries that has some functions for automatic EDA - `DataExplorer`, `Hmisc`, `dlookr`, `explore`.

```{r}
library("DataExplorer")
library("Hmisc")
library("dlookr")
library("exploreR")
```

For each of the package, the data used comes from suggestions of packages itself. 

##DataExplorer

This package is created by Boxuan Cui. Here are showed three functions from DataExplorer package - `introduce()`, `plot_intro()`, and `create_report()`. The datasets used for a presentation - airquality and diamonds. 

```{r}
DataExplorer::introduce(airquality)
```

```{r,warning = FALSE, results='hide',message=FALSE}
DataExplorer::plot_intro(airquality)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, results='hide',message=FALSE}
DataExplorer::create_report(diamonds, y="price")
```
